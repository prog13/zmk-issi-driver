properties:
  sw-setting:
    type: int
    required: false
    enum:
      - 0x00

      - 0x08
      - 0x09
      - 0x0a
    default: 0x00
    description: |
      SW setting used to control the matrix size by turning off SWx pins
      as described in the datasheet.
  map:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Configure how RGB pixels are mapped to individual pixel registers.
  r-ext:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Rext resistor value in kiloohms.

  led-max-current:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Maximum current for each LED in mA. The chip supports up to 34mA.

  sync:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0x00
      - 0x10
      - 0x11
    required: false
    default: 0x00
    description: |
      Controls the SYNC function. Set to 0x11 to set the device as main or 0x10 for secondary. 0x00 for 'off'.
  sdb-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO pin for hardware shutdown functionality.
  chain-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      How many RGB LEDs are driven by the IC.
  scaling-red:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 255
    description: |
      Current scaling factor for red channel LEDs on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of red pixels relative to other channels by scaling
      the amount of current flowing through them. 255 equals led-max-current.
  scaling-green:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 255
    description: |
      Current scaling factor for green channel LEDs on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of green pixels relative to other channels by scaling
      the amount of current flowing through them. 255 equals led-max-current.
  scaling-blue:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 255
    description: |
      Current scaling factor for blue channel LEDs on a scale of 0-255.
      This setting adjusts the brightness of blue pixels relative to other channels by scaling
      the amount of current flowing through them. 255 equals led-max-current.
  gamma:
    type: array
    required: false
    description: |
      Gamma correction lookup values.
      The gamma values make the LED brightness seem more linear to human eyes.
      Default values match the recommendation from the IC datasheet but note that this may
      or may not apply for your particular LEDs.
